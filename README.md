Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning. It involves defining the scope of the project, gathering requirement and creating a roadmap for the development process
2. Analysis: It ibvolves understanding the end-user needs, identifying use cases and defining system requirement
3. Design: It includes architectural design, database design, and detailing of the software modules
4. Implementation: also known as coding or development. It involves the actual coding of the software based on the design specifications
5. Testing: It involves testing to identify defects or bugs
6. Deployment: The movement of software to the production environment for end-users
7. Maintenance:  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1, Approach:waterfall is sequential while Agile is iterative and incremental
2. Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid with fixed requirement while Agile is flexible and adaptive to change
3. Risk Mangement: Waterfall struggles with handling changes whereas Agile mitigates risks by addressing issues early in the development process
4. Customer Involvement: Agile involes continous customer feedback, while Waterfall has less customer involvement after the initial requirements phase
Scenario
1.Waterfall Methodology
A government agency needs to develop a software system to manage regulating compliance across multiple departments. waterfall is appropriate here because regulatory requirement are typically stable and well-defined
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
2. Agile Metholodology
   Developing a Mobile Banking Application

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE and VCS play critical roles in modern software deveolpment workflows by enhancing developer productivity, facilitating collaboration among team members, ensuring code quality and stability, and supporting afficient project management and deployment processes, integrating these tools effectively can significantly improve the speed, efficiency and reliability of software development projects.
Example of IDE are Intellij IDEA, Visual Studio(VS) Code, PyCharm
Example of VSC are Git, Subversion. Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
